    "## Introduction\n",
    "### A. The Entertainment Domain\n",
    "My project will take place in the entertainment domain and deal primarily with my Netflix consumption patterns. Netflix and TV shows in general are certainly prevelant in my daily life. In general, I try to be careful about the amount of time I spend watching Netflix and consuming other digital media in order to ensure that I am not forgetting to live my life and that I am not getting addicted to watching certain shows. The entertainment domain is something that I am continuously aware of and trying to track in my everday life. It is certainly important for society as a whole to be looking into this domain, looking at the factors that impact our consumption within this domain, and reflecting on the impact that this domain has on our lives. I am reasearching this domain because I am particularly interested in finding out if factors outside of this domain, in this case weather, can have a significant impact on how much time we spend within the entertainment domain.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Hypotheses\n",
    "My hypothesis about this domain is that I will find a correlation between my Netflix viewing habits and the weather. I believe that when the weather is colder, then my total time watching Netflix is above average. In addition to this, I also believe the opposite. When the weather is warmer, my total time watching netflix is below my average. The impact of these results could help me in the long run as I try to be conscious and limit the amount of time I spend on Netflix. If I am aware that colder weather has an impact on my viewing patterns, it will help me to remember to be more conscious about it on days when the weather is colder. My roommates are also stakeholders in this study due to the fact that I force them to watch Netflix with me in our apartment. If it is true that the weather effects our viewing patterns, then it is effecting my roommates as well as myself. Netflix as a company is also a stakeholder in this. If there are more people using their platform on a given day they need to make sure that everything is running smoothly and quickly. However, on a warmer day when not as many people are watching, it is not as likely that there will be problems on their platform."

    "## Data Analysis\n",
    "### A. Dataset Description\n",
    "The first table that will be used in the dataset is my netflix data table. This table is downloaded from my account on netflix. It is downloaded as a CSV file and contains three different attributes. The first is a categorical, specifically nominal, attribute, it is the name of the TV show/specific episode or movie that I watched. The second is an ordinal attribute, this attribute holds the date that the show or movie was watched. The final attribute for this table is continuous and contains the length of the show or movie that I watched. This attribute was added manually by me after the data was downloaded.    \n",
    "The second table that I want to join with the first is a data from the MeteoStat API. The documentation about the API can be found at the following URL: https://dev.meteostat.net/docs/. There are three attributes that I will focus on. The first attribute is the date, this is the attribute that I plan to use as the key to merge the two datasets together. The second attribute is an interval attribute and will describe the average temperature in degrees fahrenheit for that date. The third and fourth attributes are ratio attributes, with the third holding the amount of precipitation and snowfall for each date in the table."

    "Looking at these raw stats from above, the mean of the low temperature is higher than the mean of the high category, however, the standard deviation of the low category is larger than the mean of the low category. To get a better sense of where the mean of each category confidence intervals will be computed for each category. Using the above mean and standard deviation of each temperature category, the confidence intervals will be computed. These confidence intervals will be found at 95%. "
